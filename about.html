              Hello, my name is Anit Annadi and this is an essay telling you
              about me. I am currently a sophomore at Dublin High School and I
              hope to be a computer programmer at Google when I grow up. To do
              this I plan to go to a 4 year college majoring in computer
              science. This will allow me to develop the knowledge and skills
              needed for this challenging job.
            </p>
            <p class="about-page-text">
              Strengths and personal qualities that I have that would help me
              become an excellent computer programmer are that I am a hard
              worker, good at communicating, and very patient. I have gained all
              these skills while playing basketball from 1st grade to 10th
              grade. I would need to work hard to get better at the game to keep
              my starting position. On the court, I had to communicate with my
              teammates to start a play and I had to be patient waiting for them
              to pass me the ball. Even though I learned these skills from a
              sport it will be very beneficial to me in my computer programming
              career. Since hard work is needed to complete large programs,
              communication is needed to communicate with coworkers, and finally
              patience is needed for when your program isn't working how you
              want it to be. Over the years of my childhood, I have had many
              achievements such as getting a Principal's Honor Roll every year,
              averaging 15 points in my Amateur Athlete Union basketball games,
              and successfully advancing to the state-wide competition for VEX
              Robotics on team 5327S. Also over the years, I have taken many
              hard classes. I struggled throughout them but prevailed by
              committing myself to it and working hard. Taking these hard
              classes taught me the importance of being committed and hard work.
            </p>
            <p class="about-page-text">
              My future dream job is to be a computer programmer. Even though I
              know this path is very hard and only a small percentage of people
              achieve it I will do whatever it takes to achieve it. I will work
              hard everyday no matter what to be the best I can possibly be.
              Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this letter,
              please consider looking at the rest of my site.
