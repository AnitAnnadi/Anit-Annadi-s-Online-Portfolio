            </p>
            <p class="project-page-project-text">
              The objective of this project was to create a compound machine
              that uses at least four different simple machines, to accomplish a
              task. First, my group and I decided on the four different simple
              machines we would use (inclined plane, pulley, axle driving wheel,
              and first class lever). We then decided that the task to complete
              would be raising up keys. This would help older people who are not
              flexible enough to bend down have easier access to their keys.
              Throughout the project, I primarily focused on building. I helped
              build the axle driving the wheel, the first-class lever, and the
              inclined plane. Two of my other partners also helped greatly in
              the building process, with my third partner focusing primarily on
              the project documentation. The challenges we faced during this
              project were having the right side of the first-class lever stay
              lifted up when a weight was dropped on the left side, and placing
              all the simple machines in the right place so everything would
              work as designed. To overcome the challenge with the first class
              lever, we taped a small counterweight to the left side of the
              first-class lever. This allowed the left side to stay down and the
              right side to stay up when a bigger weight was dropped on the left
              side. To overcome the challenge with the placement of the simple
              machines, we used trial and error. We adjusted all the simple
              machines and tested, until the task was completed consistently. As
              the project progressed, we all had great communication, planned
              effectively, and also utilized the time we had in class. When one
              of us was stuck on something, the others always helped. This
              project taught me how to combine different simple machines to
              complete a task, effectively plan out a project or task, and draw
              detailed/accurate sketches.

              The objective of this project was to create a hangman game that
              met all the requirements said in the AP Create Task Rubric. Me and
              my partners plan was to have the user guess a letter. If they get
              a letter correct the word with that letter filled in will appear
              in the terminal. Then they are asked if they want to guess the
              whole word which they can answer yes or no to. If they answer no
              they are asked to guess another letter, but if yes they enter
              their guess of the whole word. If the word is correct then the
              game ends, if it isn't the amount of incorrect guesses they have
              left is reduced by one. If the letter guessed is incorrect then
              the user is told their guess was wrong, and the amount of
              incorrect guesses they have left is reduced by one. If the amount
              of incorrect guesses reaches is 0 or if they guess all the letters
              in the word, the game ends. In this project I did almost all the
              programming, while my partner did most of the documentation. After
              we both finished our parts we both gave tips to each other on how
              to improve, which we used to improve our code and documentation.
              Throughout the project we only had one challenge which was meeting
              the requirements said in the AP Create Task Rubric, but we
              overcame this by meeting for an hour outside of class and
              brainstorming ideas on how to meet the requirements. Throughout
              the project me and my partner stayed in contact with each other,
              threw texts, listened to each other's ideas, and helped each other
              out when one of us was stuck. When one of us was too busy the
              other took leadership and did the tasks that needed to be done. I
              believe this teamwork and leadership was the reason we were able
              to create a high quality project in a short amount of time.
              Working on this project taught me how to document better and the
              importance of open-mindedness.

              The objective of this project was to create a project to meet all
              the requirements said in the AP Create Task Rubric. Me and my
              partner decided to create a firefighter animation where a
              helicopter is dumping water on a fire extinguishing it with the
              help of a firefighter. I programmed the trees, helicopter, the
              helicopter dumping water on fire animation, and the ending screen.
              While my partner programmed the fire, firefighters with hose, fire
              trucks, and finally the background. We faced many challenges
              throughout the course of the project. Big ones were finding times
              that work for both of us since we both were very busy and making
              the animations and drawings look as realistic as possible. To
              overcome the time challenge we both texted each other constantly
              to try and make times to meet up and to show what each of us had
              programmed or done on our own. To overcome the challenge of the
              drawings not looking realistic enough, we redid some of the
              drawings and animations. Throughout this project we had great
              communication, great conversations, and we both listened to each
              other's ideas. When one of us was stuck on a program the other
              took leadership and helped out the other. We were both able to
              depend on each other. This project taught me so many things such
              as the importance of teamwork, importance of communications, and
              to utilize the resources around you such as teachers and peers.
